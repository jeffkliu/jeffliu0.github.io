From learning how to write custom Javascript properties right into a <script> tag, all the way to using handlebars, lodash, and jQuery calls in order to edit certain parts of an html file, it had taught me creative thinking. Building a rigid, monolithic, and flat front-end application using the above methods definitely wasn't a problem. However,  discovering how you can use ReactJS (especially with adoption of ES6) to simplify all above process can make your code much more modular, easily-accessed, and reusable.

ReactJS, so far, is definitely a framework that promotes simplicity. However, it was definitely a pain for me to learn in the beginning. Having to manage the props, states, stores, and actions definitely became a hassle. When we dove deeper into the labs building out the +/- counter, unidirectional lab, and creating the tic-tac-toe game, it made me even more confused. It felt like the labs took forever to finish!

However, there were many resources out there to aid with the process. Google was definitely one of your close friends at this point. You can also reach out to the community for help. There's a reason for this open-endedness to some of these labs and that is for you to study what you read before, or even to read ahead.

What I've learned while coding with ReactJS is that you're not alone scratching your head trying so hard to fix this issue. Coding helps you become a better problem solver; It teaches you how to be creative when trying to figure out a solution.

With that being said, time to finish this difficult wikipedia search lab. 

Good luck everyone.
